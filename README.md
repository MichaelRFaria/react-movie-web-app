# Overview

This project was created using React and uses [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB) as an API.

This project is my first time using an API and using React to create a web application, which has greatly improved my understanding of web applications.

The app allows you to view, rate and search for movies taken from TMDB API. Routing is used to display multiple different webpages, and local storage to ensure movie ratings persist between page reloads.

Improvements I would like to make in the future consist of:
- implementing TypeScript
- implementing a backend to store movie ratings
- securing my API key (oops)
- overall improvement in program efficiency and clarity by deepening my knowledge and understanding in React

## Required scripts

In the project directory, you must run:

### `npm install`

Installs required package dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
